DWITE-2012-2013-High-School-Round-1----Question--1-Solution--PHP
================================================================

A PHP solution to Question #1 of the DWITE 2012-2013 High School Programming Competition (Round 1, Question 1).

## How it works

If you are familiar with the question, you will know that the program is supposed to read values line by line from a file called DATA.txt. It then makes piles of ASCII asterisk (*) characters which are (at their highest point) the height of the value from each specific line.

Problem 1
Candy Piles
After collecting a lot of candy this Halloween, the most obvious next step is to organize it into piles and draw graphs of the loot. Of course.

The input file DATA1.txt will contain 5 lines, each a single positive integer describing the height of candy piles.

The output file OUT1.txt will contain an ASCII drawing of the piles of candy. A triangle of asterics will approximate such piles. Refer to the sample below.
